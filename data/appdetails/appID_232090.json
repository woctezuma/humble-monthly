Formerly known as Kevin Clamely, the CEO and founder of Horzine Biotech, the Patriarch has found his way to KILLING FLOOR 2 and he\u2019s back with a vengeance. Feared by all, the Patriarch is even deadlier than ever, with new attacks that very few will be able to survive.<br><br>Additionally, two new maps will be included in the Return of the Patriarch Content Pack. The new Farmhouse map takes players into a misty, dimly-lit farmhouse far from civilization. With deadly Zeds crawling around every corner, players must do their best to destroy them all. They\u2019ll also find themselves isolated from humanity in the new Black Forest map where dangerous creatures live deep within the woods.<br><br><img src=\"http://cdn.edgecast.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/232090/extras/KF2_Return_of_the_Patriarch_CSI-Small_01.jpg?t=1515528655\" ><br><img src=\"http://cdn.edgecast.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/232090/extras/KF2_Return_of_the_Patriarch_CSI-Small_02.jpg?t=1515528655\" ><br><img src=\"http://cdn.edgecast.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/232090/extras/KF2_Return_of_the_Patriarch_CSI-Small_03.jpg?t=1515528655\" ><br><img src=\"http://cdn.edgecast.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/232090/extras/KF2_Return_of_the_Patriarch_CSI-Small_04.jpg?t=1515528655\" ></p><br><h1>Trading Cards</h1><p><img src=\"http://cdn.edgecast.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/232090/extras/KF2_SteamTC-launch_Banner.png?t=1515528655\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Get ready for a bloody good time this Halloween with monster-sized discounts for both <i>KILLING FLOOR</i> and <i>KILLING FLOOR 2</i>!
